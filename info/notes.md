# Notes

## Next steps

 - Reach out to people and get a better sense of what's possible with NLP.
 - Talk to companies in the space and see if this is a solution that they would desire.
 - Look into all the customer service platforms and see how their message structure can be symbiotic with a chat structure.

## Timeline
4/1/16
Get an idea of how much this is needed and get a sense of how much of a technical solution there is. 
Talk to 3 people for both. Due date is 4/7/16
